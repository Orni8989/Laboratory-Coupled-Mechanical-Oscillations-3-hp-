# Coupled Oscillations Lab
Carl Ã–rnberg and Jonathan Nguyen.

This lab focuses on analyzing coupled oscillations. Advanced programming in python was used to analyze large data sets and perform numerical analysis algorithms such as Fast Fourier Transforms.

## Contents
It consists of two main parts:

Two Pendulums Coupled by a Spring: We investigated the behavior of two pendulums connected by a spring.
Simple Harmonic Motion Approximation: We examined whether a single pendulum can be approximated as a simple harmonic oscillator.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis was performed using the following files:

Analys_pendel: Compared the period times for different initial angles of a pendulum.

Labbplottar: Conducted a Fourier analysis to determine the system's frequencies for various setups.

Labbplottar_olikamassor: Similar to Labbplottar but with different masses.

plott_frekvenser: Compared the frequencies obtained from the Fourier analysis with analytical frequencies.

All experiments were conducted using a high-frequency camera, and the data was analyzed from various TSV files.

## Report
An obligatory report was written by me and Jonathan. See "Laboratory Report (in Swedish)".
